# MySailLog - Digital Sailing Logbook Application

## Overview
MySailLog will be a mobile application designed to help sailors maintain a digital logbook of their sailing activities. This will replace traditional paper logbooks with a modern, feature-rich digital solution.

## Core Features

### 1. Trip Logging âœ…
- Start/end time of sailing sessions
- GPS tracking of routes
- Weather conditions (wind speed/direction, temperature, sea state)
- Crew members present
- Vessel details

### 2. Safety Information ðŸš§
- Equipment checks (Pending)
- Safety gear inventory (Pending)
- Emergency contacts (Pending)
- Maintenance records (Pending)
- Weather alerts (Pending)

### 3. Navigation Features âš¡
- Real-time GPS position âœ…
- Course plotting (Pending)
- Speed logging âœ…
- Distance traveled âœ…
- Anchor position marking (Pending)

### 4. Data Collection ðŸš§
- Fuel/battery consumption (Pending)
- Engine hours (Pending)
- Water tank levels (Pending)
- Photos and notes (Pending)
- Maintenance tasks (Pending)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend âœ…
- React Native for cross-platform mobile development
- Offline-first architecture for use at sea
- GPS and sensor integration
- Camera integration for photos
- Local storage with SQLite

### Backend ðŸš§
- Node.js/Express backend (Future phase)
- MongoDB for flexible data storage (Future phase)
- Authentication system (Local implementation complete)
- Cloud sync when internet available (Future phase)
- Weather API integration âœ…

## Development Phases

2. Advanced navigation (Pending)
3. Weather routing (Future phase)
4. Historical data analysis (Pending)
5. Export capabilities (Pending)

## User Experience Considerations âš¡
1. Must be usable in marine conditions âœ…
   - Large, clear buttons
   - High contrast display
   - Water-resistant UI considerations
2. Offline-first approach âœ…
3. Battery efficiency âœ…
4. Easy one-handed operation âœ…
5. Quick entry for common tasks âœ…

## Security Considerations ðŸš§
1. User authentication âœ…
2. Data encryption (Pending)
3. Secure cloud sync (Future phase)
4. Privacy controls (Pending)
5. Backup solutions (Pending)

## Next Steps
1. ~~Set up development environment~~ âœ…
2. ~~Create initial React Native project~~ âœ…
3. ~~Implement core MVP features~~ âœ…
4. Begin testing with actual sailors
5. Iterate based on feedback

## Questions for Discussion
1. ~~Should we prioritize iOS or Android for initial release?~~ âœ… (Android chosen)
2. ~~What specific weather APIs should we integrate with?~~ âœ… (OpenWeatherMap)
3. Do we need to consider integration with existing marine electronics?
4. What regulatory requirements need to be considered?
5. Should we implement any specific sailing community features?
