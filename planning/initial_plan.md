# MySailLog - Digital Sailing Logbook Application

## Overview
MySailLog will be a mobile application designed to help sailors maintain a digital logbook of their sailing activities. This will replace traditional paper logbooks with a modern, feature-rich digital solution.

## Core Features

### 1. Trip Logging
- Start/end time of sailing sessions
- GPS tracking of routes
- Weather conditions (wind speed/direction, temperature, sea state)
- Crew members present
- Vessel details

### 2. Safety Information
- Equipment checks
- Safety gear inventory
- Emergency contacts
- Maintenance records
- Weather alerts

### 3. Navigation Features
- Real-time GPS position
- Course plotting
- Speed logging
- Distance traveled
- Anchor position marking

### 4. Data Collection
- Fuel/battery consumption
- Engine hours
- Water tank levels
- Photos and notes
- Maintenance tasks

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React Native for cross-platform mobile development
- Offline-first architecture for use at sea
- GPS and sensor integration
- Camera integration for photos
- Local storage with SQLite

### Backend
- Node.js/Express backend
- MongoDB for flexible data storage
- Authentication system
- Cloud sync when internet available
- Weather API integration

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core MVP
1. Basic trip logging
   - Start/end trip
   - GPS tracking
   - Basic weather input
   - Vessel details
2. Simple data entry forms
3. Local storage implementation
4. Basic offline functionality

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
1. Advanced weather integration
2. Photo attachments
3. Equipment tracking
4. Maintenance logs
5. Cloud sync

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Social features
   - Share trips
   - Community insights
2. Advanced navigation
3. Weather routing
4. Historical data analysis
5. Export capabilities

## User Experience Considerations
1. Must be usable in marine conditions
   - Large, clear buttons
   - High contrast display
   - Water-resistant UI considerations
2. Offline-first approach
3. Battery efficiency
4. Easy one-handed operation
5. Quick entry for common tasks

## Security Considerations
1. User authentication
2. Data encryption
3. Secure cloud sync
4. Privacy controls
5. Backup solutions

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Create initial React Native project
3. Implement core MVP features
4. Begin testing with actual sailors
5. Iterate based on feedback

## Questions for Discussion
1. Should we prioritize iOS or Android for initial release?
2. What specific weather APIs should we integrate with?
3. Do we need to consider integration with existing marine electronics?
4. What regulatory requirements need to be considered?
5. Should we implement any specific sailing community features?
