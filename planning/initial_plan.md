# MySailLog - Digital Sailing Logbook Application

## Overview
MySailLog is a mobile application designed to help sailors maintain a digital logbook of their sailing activities. This offline-first application replaces traditional paper logbooks with a modern, feature-rich digital solution that works anywhere, with or without internet connectivity.

- Crew members present with profile photos
- Vessel details with photos

### 2. Safety Information âœ…
- Equipment checks
- Safety gear inventory
- Emergency contacts
- Maintenance records
- Weather alerts

### 3. Navigation Features âš¡

## Next Steps
1. ~~Set up development environment~~ âœ…
2. ~~Create initial React Native project~~ âœ…
3. ~~Implement core MVP features~~ âœ…
4. ~~Implement offline functionality~~ âœ…
5. Begin testing with actual sailors

## Questions for Discussion
1. ~~Should we prioritize iOS or Android for initial release?~~ âœ… (Android chosen)
2. ~~What specific weather APIs should we integrate with?~~ âœ… (OpenWeatherMap)
3. ~~Do we need to consider integration with existing marine electronics?~~ âœ… (Phase 2)
4. What regulatory requirements need to be considered?
5. Should we implement any specific sailing community features?
