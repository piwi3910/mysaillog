     salt: string;
     created: Date;
     settings: UserSettings;
   }

   interface TripLog {
     id: string;
     userId: string;
     startTime: Date;
     endTime?: Date;
     route: GeoPoint[];
     weather: WeatherData;
     notes: string;
     imageRefs?: string[]; // Local file system references
   }
   ```

### Data Architecture

1. Local Storage Schema
   ```typescript
   interface Vessel {
     id: string;
     userId: string;
     name: string;
     type: string;
     length: number;
     registrationNumber?: string;
     equipment: Equipment[];
   }

   interface Equipment {
     id: string;
     vesselId: string;
     name: string;
     type: string;
     lastMaintenance?: Date;
     notes: string;
   }

   interface Trip {
     id: string;
     vesselId: string;
     startLocation: GeoPoint;
     endLocation?: GeoPoint;
     crewMembers: CrewMember[];
     weatherConditions: WeatherData[];
     engineHours?: number;
     fuelUsage?: number;
   }

   interface WeatherData {
     timestamp: Date;
     temperature: number;
     windSpeed: number;
     windDirection: number;
     pressure: number;
     notes: string;
   }
   ```
